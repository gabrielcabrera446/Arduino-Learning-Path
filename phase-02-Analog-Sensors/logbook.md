## 🔹 Project 1: Analog Reading with Potentiometer
**⏱️ Estimated Time:** 1 hour  
**📌 Issue Registered**

**Problem Description:** Needed to identify and wire the potentiometer correctly. Initial confusion with rotary encoder and orientation.  
**How It Was Detected:** Through physical inspection and pin verification on breadboard.  
**Solution Applied:** Verified the WH148 10kΩ model, explained terminal mapping in text. Connected to 5V, GND, and A0.  
**Key Learning:** Introduction to analog inputs, ADC resolution, use of Serial Monitor, converting analog values to voltage.
